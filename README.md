# What adjustment I have made for m > 1 and why





#### Iterating along Y-axis

When the slope was less than 1, it was guranteed that the x value will increase by 1 in each iteration. But now as the slow is greater than 1, the y value will increase by 1 in each iteration.

#### Adjust the next decision parameter

Previously we had to take the decision of whether we will take 
y or y+1. But now we will take decision based on x values.


#### Swap the role of x and y
